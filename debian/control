Description: automates use of a flash disk as the root filesystem
 Flashybrid is a system to help in setting up and managing hybrid
 flash/disk/ram based Debian systems which can run most of the time
 using only a small flash disk for their root filesystem and do a useful,
 but limited task (such as being a router, or a PDA, or a rescue system
 on a USB keydrive). The flash can be as small as 32 mb, though 64 to 256
 mb is more comfortable. 
 .
 To use this package, you will need a 2.4 or greater version of the Linux
 kernel, with tmpfs support built in.
