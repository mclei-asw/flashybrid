  * New maintainers
  * Merge changes from Xorcom Rapid distribution into Debian (Closes: #352932)
    - Insert changelog items from Rapid dale (Xorcom's current stable version).
    - It looks quite weird, do due conflicts in version numbering.

    - Added option to remove verbosity level.
    - Added option option to specify maximum amount of memory to use.
    - Modified configuration to match Sarge and Etch software.
  * Removed the full configuration and embedded configuration.
  * Only ramtmp and ramdisk are supported right now, all other configurations
    are obsolete.

    will be applied on the next reboot.

    carefully.
